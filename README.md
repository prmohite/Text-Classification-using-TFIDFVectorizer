# 📝 Text-Classification-using-TFIDFVectorizer

## 🧩 Problem statement:

### A. 
📚 Build a classification model to distinguish between 3G and 4G.  
📂 Use the **3and4G_patents.csv** file for this purpose.  
🛠️ Preprocess the texts, create a document-term matrix using a **TfidfVectorizer**, create training and test sets, and use **LogisticRegression** and **RandomForestClassifier** to predict whether a given text is 3G or 4G.  
📈 Display the **classification report** and the **confusion matrix**.

### B. 
🔎 Pick any instance and use **LIME** to determine the words that contributed to its prediction.
